  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/svgs/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Proxima Nova
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Fontspring-DEMO-proximanova-extrabold.otf
          weight: 800
          style: normal
        - asset: fonts/Fontspring-DEMO-proximanova-medium.otf
          weight: 500
          style: normal
        - asset: fonts/Fontspring-DEMO-proximanova-semibold.otf
